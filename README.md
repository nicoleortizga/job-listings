# [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - Job listings with filtering

![Design preview for the Job listings with filtering challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Challenge

 The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
 
 Your users should be able to:

   * View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
   * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
   * Filter job listings based on the categories selected
 
## Motivation

I've started learning Vue, and I thought this design was great to practice what I've learned so far.

## Project setup
`yarn install`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
`yarn serve`

### Compiles and minifies for production
`yarn build` 

### Lints and fixes files
`yarn lint`
